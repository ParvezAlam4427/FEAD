            <h2>The Story of Five Frogs</h2>
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1358/1*rFk4ep7Qh4LfNzqV77QwLA.jpeg" alt="Five Frogs on a Lily Pad" class="story-image">
            <p>Once upon a time, there were five frogs sitting on a lily pad.</p>
            <p>One frog decided to jump off. How many are left?</p>
            <p>If your answer is “four”, thank your maths teacher for your excellent maths skills. Unfortunately, this is not a test of your maths abilities.</p>
            <p>It’s a life problem.</p>
            <p>The correct answer is “five”. Yes, all five are still sitting there on the lily pad.</p>
            <p>The one frog only decided to jump but hasn’t.</p>
            <p>Life is not a spectator sport; it’s indeed a contact sport, and there are no practice sessions, and you’ve been in the game from day one.</p>
            <p>As cliché as it seems ‘The journey starts with a single step’ — not by thinking about taking that step.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Be the frog who not only decides to jump off the lily pad but actually jumps.</p>

            <h2>The Story of the Tortoise and the Hare</h2>
            <img src="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/05/65/76/91/360_F_565769155_cH0CduJ9bDcugklpqmzOYie8GxVadwlp.jpg" alt="Tortoise and Hare" class="story-image">
            <p>Once upon a time, a tortoise and a hare had an argument about who was faster.</p>
            <p>They decided to settle the argument with a race. They agreed on a route and started off the race.</p>
            <p>The hare shot ahead and ran briskly for some time. Then, seeing he was far ahead of the tortoise, he thought he’d sit down and rest for a while before continuing the race. He sat down under a tree and soon fell fast asleep.</p>
            <p>The tortoise, plodding along, soon overtook him, passed him, crossed the finish line, and won the race.</p>
            <p>The hare woke up and realized he’d lost.</p>
            <p>Many people will conclude that Slow and Steady win the race. When I read the story, I feel that the real lesson is not about the tortoise at all, it’s about the hare.</p>
            <p>The hare made a huge mistake, believing in its ability but then not actually proving it. In real life, you may have that great skill, one which everyone agrees, but you must still showcase that skill to win the competition.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Success depends on using your talents, not just having them.</p>

            <h2>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h2>
            <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQFF9iqzjcOm5w/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1520103398081?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=V3UnjJIgxG8H7P3EciC6-qQHF6WYCxMmeq288e_mTI8" alt="Boy Who Cried Wolf" class="story-image">
            <p>Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill. To amuse himself, he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf! The sheep are being chased by the wolf!” The villagers came running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their angry faces.</p>
            <p>“Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there’s no wolf boy!”, they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed at them.</p>
            <p>After a while, he got bored and cried ‘wolf!’ again, fooling the villagers a second time. The angry villagers warned the boy a second time and left. The boy continued watching the flock. After a while, he saw a real wolf and cried loudly, “Wolf! Please help! The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help!”</p>
            <p>But this time, no one turned up to help. By evening, when the boy didn’t return home, the villagers wondered what happened to him and went up to the hill. The boy sat on the hill weeping. “Why didn’t you come when I called out that there was a wolf?” he asked angrily. “The flock is scattered now”, he said.</p>
            <p>An old villager approached him and said, “People won’t believe liars even when they tell the truth. We’ll look for your sheep tomorrow morning. Let’s go home now”.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Lying breaks trust. Nobody trusts a liar, even when he is telling the truth.</p>

            <h2>Remember to care for those who matter</h2>
            <img src="https://assets.randomactsofkindness.org/quotes/images/339/medium_grinch_quote.jpg" alt="Family Matters" class="story-image">
            <p>Yet another Thai commercial, this time on the topic of family.</p>
            <p>‘Silence of love’ shows the sacrifices a deaf-mute father makes for his daughter, despite facing numerous rejections from her teenage daughter who thinks her father doesn’t understand her. I urge all of you to treasure your family members and thank them for being there no matter what you are going through in your life.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Family — where life begins and Love never ends.</p>
            <p>Conclusion Learning is never finished. Some of these lessons come from experience, yet there are others that we learn watching others or reading in books or watching videos. Hope you have learnt something today! Cheers, Shuxin.</p>
